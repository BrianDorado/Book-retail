    description: `Marriage between a man and a woman has been the divine pattern originating in the Garden of Eden with our First Parents (Genesis 1:26-27) , and this union has been the traditional form of marriage for millennia. The First Couple were married by God before death entered the world. Therefore, marriage was intended to be an eternal relationship. It is made possible through the resurrection brought about by Jesus Christ. A priesthood key restored by Elijah seals a couple together for ‘time and for eternity.’\n\nOf course all marriages have interesting challenges that surface over the life cycle. There are  basically two approaches to assist Latter-day Saint couples in their quest for marital happiness: (1) a gospel, or doctrinal-based perspective, and (2) a secular or non-religious approach, the foundation of professional counseling protocols.\n\nThe point of this volume: Why not try a gospel-based approach to resolve marital issues? The principles of the gospel, when understood and practiced by both spouses, have the greatest chance of helping Latter-day Saint couples build strong, stable marriages, the kind of marriages that inspire both partners to value their relationship and to develop a companionship that creates in both a desire to be ‘together forever.’\n\nDuring his ministry, President Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was fond of stating that doctrine was a powerful tool in changing and improving behavior. “True doctrine, understood,” he said, “will change behavior quicker than will the study of behavior change behavior’ This book attests to that principle.`

    name: "What We Wish We'd Known Before Our Honeymoon",

    description: "Marriage is the great adventure of mortality. We rejoice as parents, siblings, and friends when we receive an invitation to a reception of someone we know and love. Having been worthy to marry in a Church temple, surely they anticipate with some enthusiasm, at the end of their courtship and now sealing, to begin a life of sexual intimacy that binds their hearts and souls together.\n\nHowever, heading off on a honeymoon to a private location, a common tradition for LDS couples, requires a little planning to find a place to spend a few days of private time. Some opt for an ocean cruise to Mexican resorts or to Alaska, some opt for California and the theme parks there. Others head for the beauty of Yellowstone, Glacier National Park, or even Banff, Canada, and the stunning sites in the land to the north. The idea is to get away from family and friends in a secluded place where they can make plans for their immediate future. An important part of the honeymoon period will be learning from each other the intricacies of physical intimacy.\n\nThough highly anticipated by these couples, sexual relations were often more difficult for them than portrayed by actors in films. In fact, as you will see, many couples found the first few nights of their time together rather challenging and often disappointing. However, the joy of being together, of exploring male/female attributes now as legal companions, they had to learn from each other facets of intimacy such as arousal, passion, and intercourse--important elements of their new companionship. This book is designed to help newlyweds achieve success in the intimate exchange of being husband and wife."

Read how this little snowman found his own answers and maybe you too will learn how to really \"see\" Christmas."

The present inhabitants, the Gentiles, appear to be headed toward a similar fate as did the previous inhabitants. This book shows how each of the three previous civilizations went through ten stages from start to 'finish,' the Lamanites - the only survivors of the Lehite colonization.  The question of what stage are the Gentiles presently in and what does the future hold for them is detailed from both Book of Mormon and modern day prophets' comments."
